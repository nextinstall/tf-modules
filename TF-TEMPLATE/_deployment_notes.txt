When using this template you must make some changes depending on the type (or requirement) for a load balancer
for your application.

You must remove the .ignore suffix from the load balancer you wish to deploy and make sure
the other load balancer types are ignored with a .ignore suffix.

so:
apploadbalancer.tf #this deploys the application load balancer with noted configuration
elasticloadbalancer-classic.tf #this deploys a classic/elasitc load balancer with noted configuration
